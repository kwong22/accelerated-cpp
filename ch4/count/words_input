In the previous section we introduced two key components in context of the image
classification task:

A (parameterized) score function mapping the raw image pixels to class scores
(e.g. a linear function)
A loss function that measured the quality of a particular set of parameters
based on how well the induced scores agreed with the ground truth labels in the
training data. We saw that there are many ways and versions of this (e.g.
Softmax/SVM).
